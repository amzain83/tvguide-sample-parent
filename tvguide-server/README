This project is meant to model a hypothetical persistence mechanism - it isn't here as a demonstration of how anything should be done. For that reason, it has no dependencies on GWT, but is used by the tvguide-client project.

Details what data there is, how to store and get it, and the API used to read and write from external interfaces. The tvguide-client project is one such interface, and provides remaining important features like session support, and a particular implementation of Jpa support.
